# HR-Attrition-
This HR dataset has eight features using which we will predict the target variable called "left".
Using the number of project, average monthly hours, time_spend_company, promotion in last 5 years the employees are evaluated. Based on the performance of an employee and the respected credits given to them we will predict whether an employee will retain or leave the organisation and we will find the major cause behind their termination.
